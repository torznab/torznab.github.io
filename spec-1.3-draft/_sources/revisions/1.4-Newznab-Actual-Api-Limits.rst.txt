Summary
-------

Currently users can only determine their current api and grab limits and usage in their profile page.
This revision introduces an additional element in the api response to provide this information to clients directly,
allowing them to rate limit their api calls.

Actual Api Limits
-----------------

Add a `newznab:apilimits` element to the api response.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: xml
  
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <rss>
         <channel>
            ...
            <newznab:response offset="0" total="10000" />
            <newznab:apilimits apiCurrent="3" apiMax="100" />
            ...
         </channel>
      </rss>

Clients |SHOULD| not assume the `apilimits` element or any of it's attributes to be present in the api response.

Servers |MAY| include the `apilimits` element if the server has api/grab limits.

The `apilimits` element may contain the following attributes:

.. table::
   :class: small
   
   ====================   =======  =======   =========================================================
   name                   type     default   description
   ====================   =======  =======   =========================================================
   apiCurrent             number   0         The number of api calls that have been exhaused in the last 24 hours
   apiMax                 number   ∞         The number of api calls that may be used in a 24 hours
   grabCurrent            number   0         The number of grabs that have been used in the last 24 hours
   grabMax                number   ∞         The number of grabs that may be used in a 24 hours
   apiNextAvailable       string             UTC Timestamp specifying the time at which apiCurrent will be decremented
   grabNextAvailable      string             UTC Timestamp specifying the time at which grabCurrent will be decremented
   ====================   =======  =======   =========================================================

Clients |SHOULD| not make further api calls if the `apiCurrent` is equal or greater than `apiMax` until a reasonable time has passed.
'Reasonable time' becomes the time specified by `apiNextAvailable` if it's provided.

Servers |SHOULD| provide the `apiCurrent`, `apiMax`, `grabCurrent` and `grabMax` attributes when any such limit exists.

Servers |SHOULD| return values matching the state after the current api call has been completed.

Servers |MAY| provide the `apiNextAvailable` and `grabNextAvailable` attributes.

.. note::

   Servers should avoid including attributes that require additional database lookups to avoid an increase in the server's load.
   However, the `apiCurrent` and `apiMax` attributes are quite beneficial to clients and should be included whenever possible.
   
   It's likely possible to refactor the sql queries to provide the desired information in a single db query.

.. TODO:: Incomplete

Example
-------

A client has almost reached the api limit, a query at 2019-07-16 11:56 UTC returns:

.. code-block:: xml

   <newznab:apilimits apiCurrent="90" apiMax="100" grabCurrent="5" grabMax="5" apiNextAvailable="Tue, 16 Jul 2019 20:56:54 +0000" />

The client only has 10 api calls left in the next 8 hours, so should limit itself to one api call (rss) per hour.
This means that the client has exhausted all available grabs, it is unknown at which a new grab becomes available, but a future api call will show when it does.

Adoption
--------

These changes were discussed with the newznab staff in mid 2019, but may take some time to be in use by indexers.
