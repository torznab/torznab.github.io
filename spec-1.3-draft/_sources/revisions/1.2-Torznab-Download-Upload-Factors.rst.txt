v1.2 - Torznab Download/Upload Factors
======================================

:Status:       **Adopted** |torznab|
:Date:         September 2016
:Attributions: - kaso17

Summary
-------

Torznab currently specifies `minimumratio` and `minimumseedtime` to specify to clients how long the release must be seeded.
However, these attributes are not useful for prioritisation of free/neutral leech releases.
Therefore this proposal introduces `downloadvolumefactor` and `uploadvolumefactor` as optional extended attributes.

Download/Upload Credits
-----------------------

Many private trackers track the total amount of data a user downloads and uploads, these global 'credits' are used to determine global ratio and influences the perks available to the user such as promotions.
Certain types of torrents are given bonuses to how much the torrent activity contributes to the user account.

Add the following extended attributes:

.. table::
   :class: small
   
   ====================   =======  =======   =========================================================
   name                   type     default   description
   ====================   =======  =======   =========================================================
   downloadvolumefactor   decimal  1.0       Multiplier for the download volume that counts toward the
                                             user's account on the tracker. Freeleech would be `0.0`.
   uploadvolumefactor     decimal  1.0       Multiplier for the upload volume that counts toward the
                                             user's account on the tracker.
   ====================   =======  =======   =========================================================

Many trackers have certain bonuses for internal releases, such as 'freeleech' (`downloadvolumefactor` = `0`) or 2x upload bonus (`uploadvolumefactor` = `2.0`).
These generic attributes will allow indexers to properly specify what applies for each individual release.

Clients |SHALL| parse the value as decimal number using the period (`.`) as optional decimal separator.

Clients |SHALL| validate the value of the attributes and reject negative or extreme values.

Example
-------

A tracker has a release that by their rules must be seeded for 24 hours, or 1:1 ratio, whichever comes first. |br|
It is an internal release and as such gets a 2x upload bonus. |br|
The release in the api result will have the following attributes:

.. code-block:: xml

   <torznab:attr name="minimumratio" value="1.0" />
   <torznab:attr name="minimumseedtime" value="86400" />
   <torznab:attr name="downloadvolumefactor" value="1.0" />
   <torznab:attr name="uploadvolumefactor" value="2.0" />

`minimumratio` is still `1.0` since the upload bonus usually applies to the users global upload and ratio, not the individual torrent.
If the tracker makes the upload bonus count toward the torrent individual ratio, then `minimumratio` would be `0.5`.

Adoption
